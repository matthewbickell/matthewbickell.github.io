                <h3>Company</h3>
                <p>
                    Working for GameStop was an overall positive experience. I worked with a friendly and
                    supportive team who shared similar interests in video games and pop culture. Management
                    was strict only when it came to confidential information such as upcoming releases
                    and sales events.

                <h3>Customers</h3>
                <p>
                    Customer interactions were a mix of personalities. Most customers were kind, loyal,
                    and enjoyed discussing games and recommendations. Occasionally, upset customers appeared,
                    but problems could usually be resolved quickly by staying calm and professional.

                <h3>Takeaway</h3>
                <p>
                    Overall, GameStop was an excellent early job that helped me build strong customer
                    service skills. If you enjoy video games and pop culture, it is a great environment
                    to make friends and gain retail experience while sharing your interests with others.
